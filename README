src/nsphere /path/to/datafile 64000

The above example will plot with 64000 points, and rotate the sphere for you. By default it will plot 8000 points.

You can also run nsphere-ppm to output a single out1.ppm image to disk. This program has many optional args.

src/ppm-out/nsphere-ppm -3 /path/to/datafile
display ./out1.ppm

See 'original.txt' for the file that nsphere-ppm and this entire project is based on.
